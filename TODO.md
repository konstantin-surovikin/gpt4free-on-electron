1. Long load due to youtube block. Use gpt4free commit with hash `1d3a139a53b09be5ab8111bab38d5ffd2dd31f1e` to surpass long load
2. On my Desktop this app has specific KDE Window Setting to startup minimized to run on startup and not be up desktop. But electron [force window to activate](https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/00358545a9098158f095f47013483e83bb3b35d0). I need to rebuild electron [to not call](https://github.com/electron/electron/commit/c27cbaaaf917c316e736fe03328b0a0d5005ec3a#diff-a9f9b0a2acaa4f1907b48a585cf498ca9fbc9237cfb4bb0c40d5c15fa90dfc66R75) `NativeWindow::Show()` if "show" JS constructor object is set and use other constructor object property to set window is watchable.
